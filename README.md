Homework Assignment 10 - Time Series analysis. This assignment looks at past USD/JPY Currency pair data in order to use Forecasting and Linear Regression Modeling to predict future movements in the pair.



### Time Series Forecasting

After completing the Time Series Notebook, below are my the answers to the following questions:

1. Based on your time series analysis, would you buy the yen now?

   > Yes, I would. The prediction seems to indicate in the next 5 days a continuous increase in price. The 5 day forcast using ARMA shows a stark decrease, but with the notes ARMA will be deprecated in favor of ARIMA and ARIMA showing the steady increase, I would be very persuaded to buy now.

2. Is the risk of the yen expected to increase or decrease?

   > Based on the Garch model, the risk of the Yen is expected to increase.

3. Based on the model evaluation, would you feel confident in using these models for trading?

   > Based on these results, I am very interested and exploring these models further for trading. I am not too confident with such a small sample of test data as this, but with more research I would build more confidence in the model.

### Linear Regression Modeling

After completing the assignment, the answer to the question "Does this model perform better or worse on out-of-sample data compared to in-sample data?" is as follows:

> Based on the results I've acheived, it seems the model works similar to both in-sample as well as out-of-sample data. Both results I have achieved return a Root Mean Squared error of 0.5457296247768866.
